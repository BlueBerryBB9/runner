# Runner project

## General details
- Used Languages : C -> Graphical with LibLapin
- Time : 6 weeks
- Used Softwares : Linux / Emacs
- Teams size : 2 person but i did it alone

## Context
- During my first year at 89, the goal was to create a [old-style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=561sPCk6ByE) game using [Ray-casting method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting).
- So i decided to make a labyrinth game but you play pacman (as you can see on the minimap on the demo[^1])

## Skills : 
- Put a pixel with LibLapin.
- Draw lines.
- Compute 3D pixels position with ray casting
- Then print walls.

## Feelings on the project :
- Quite long and hard project
- Very rewarding
- Forced me to be rigorous at all times
